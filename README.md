# Cyber Write-Ups

Hello, fellow cyber enthusiast!
My name is Catarina. I'm finishing my master studies in Computer Engineering, specializing in Cybersecurity @ Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico and want to get some hands-on experience with several areas of Cybersecurity, in order to understand which is the one I want to focus on. 

I created this repository in order to share my write-ups/notes of boxes on some hacking platforms such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox.
The goal here is to deepen what I am learning in my masters degree while sharing my progress, and have a lot of fun along the way :)

Whether you are a begginer like me or an experienced cyber security professional, I would love to connect with you and learn from you as well.
